Farm Financial Health Dashboard Project Overview
This repository brings together various components of the Farm Financial Health Dashboard initiative, an ongoing effort to consolidate, analyze, and visualize Canadian agricultural data. By building a centralized and automated data pipeline—leveraging Python, Jupyter notebooks, PowerBI, and methodological frameworks from the Canadian Federation of Agriculture (CFA) and the National Index on Agri-Food Performance—we aim to provide stakeholders with timely, accessible, and decision-ready insights into Canada’s farm financial health.

Repository Contents

Farm Financial Health Report (PDF):
A written summary providing an in-depth look at key financial metrics, industry trends, and sector-wide indicators. It outlines the rationale behind the dashboard, highlighting how structured data can inform policy, strategy, and communication.

FarmFinancialHealth_compressedversion.mp4 (Video):
A short video walkthrough of the Farm Financial Health Dashboard prototype. It demonstrates the interactive features, navigation tools, and how to interpret key performance indicators (KPIs).

FarmFinancialHealthJupyterNotebook.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook):
A Python-based notebook that explores raw datasets, performs data cleaning, transformations (e.g., log transformations to reduce skewness), and preliminary analysis. It visualizes key metrics such as Net Cash Income, financial ratios, GDP contributions, and trade values, illustrating how data preprocessing informs the final dashboard.

DataVisualization (Documentation):
An explanatory document describing how the data visualization strategy was conceived. It details how a centralized dashboard reduces fragmentation, ensures data quality, and supports storytelling with data-driven insights. The focus is on turning raw metrics into actionable information.

Farm Financial Health Data Governance (Documentation):
A reference guide on data governance: sources, refresh schedules, update frequency, and citation guidelines. It specifies the origins of each dataset (Statistics Canada, custom APIs, etc.) and how the pipeline ensures data integrity and currency.

Data Dashboard - How To Update (PDF):
Instructions for maintaining and updating the dashboard’s data pipeline. This guide helps collaborators understand when and how to manually refresh data for certain indicators, how to integrate new datasets, and steps to republish the updated dashboard on the CFA’s platform.

Final Project (Dashboard Prototype and Explanation):
The heart of the project—a working prototype of the CFA’s Farm Financial Health Dashboard. 

It:
Organizes data by industry priorities and themes.
Provides a national overview of farm balance sheet data, input costs, expenses/revenues by farm type, and quarterly farm receipts.
Aligns with methodologies from the National Index on Agri-Food Performance.
Supports future plans for member-only features, public engagement, and refined data stories.


Key Features of the Dashboard
Real-Time Insights: Automated data refreshes ensure stakeholders have the most current information without repetitive manual steps.
Multi-Level Analysis: Compare national, provincial, and commodity-specific indicators.
Financial Ratios & Input Costs: Track liquidity, solvency, and profitability metrics alongside farm input price indices and wages.
Data Storytelling: Each dashboard page builds on the last, guiding users through the agricultural financial landscape—from big-picture trends to commodity-level details.
Scalability & Extensibility: The dashboard’s underlying architecture is designed to integrate more themes (e.g., environmental performance, workforce and labour dynamics) as the project evolves.

Intended Users
Policy Makers & Associations: Inform evidence-based decisions on trade, regulation, and support programs.
Primary Producers & Industry Stakeholders: Understand how macro-level trends relate to on-farm financial performance, input costs, and profitability.
Academics & Researchers: Use rich datasets for studies on agricultural economics, sustainability, and innovation.
General Public: Gain accessible insights into the health of Canada’s farms and the factors influencing the food supply chain.

How to Get Started
View the Video: Start with the provided MP4 to understand the dashboard’s navigation, layout, and features.
Explore the Jupyter Notebook: Review data preprocessing steps, transformations, and initial analysis to understand the logic behind the final visuals.

Check the Documentation:
Data Governance: Learn about data sources, update frequencies, and citation guidelines.
How To Update: Understand how to maintain and refresh datasets in PowerBI.
Feedback & Iteration: The project is a prototype. User feedback on usability, missing features, or desired metrics will shape future iterations.

Future Enhancements

Extended Themes: Integrate environmental performance indicators, labour metrics, and advanced forecasting tools.
Refined Visualizations: Add new charts, geographic overlays, and interactive filters for deeper insights.
Member-Only Features: Develop secure login functionality for premium features, custom dashboards, and proprietary data layers.
